# Exercise 8

# create two lists with the following content:
rock_list = ['gneiss', 'marl', 'limestone']

# create a dictionary called “rock_dict” with the first list as keys and the
# second list as values

print(rock_dict)

# add a new entry to the dictionary consisting of a new rock type and an
# according UCS value

# print the content of the whole dictionary to the console through formatted
# strings saying “The XX has a UCS of YY MPa”. Use a for-loop for this

for rock in rock_dict.keys():
    print(f'The {rock} has a UCS of {rock_dict[rock]} MPa')

### functions

# functions are created with the "def" keyword and have to have a name and a
# "body" in brackets after the name


def hello_world_function():  #  # basic printing function
    print('Hello World!')


# functions need to be executed like this to run
hello_world_function()


# function with input and output
def custom_subtraction(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    '''this is a custom subtraction function'''
    return a - b


print(custom_subtraction(5, 3))


# Exercise 10

# mean

    return sum(number_list) / len(number_list)

        median = (numbers_sorted[idx_median] + numbers_sorted[idx_median - 1]) / 2
    else:
        idx_median = int(n_numbers/2)
        median = numbers_sorted[idx_median]

    return median

    sum_ = sum(sum_list)

    variance = 1/len(number_list) * sum_
    return variance

    return variance**(1/2)

print(f'median value: {round(median, 2)}')
print(f'variance value: {round(variance, 2)}')

# example for function with pultiple outputs
def get_soil_properties(soil_name):

    match soil_name:  # noqa
        case 'clay':
            c, phi = 10, 20

print(soil_props)

soil_c, soil_phi = get_soil_properties(soil_name='silt')

### coding style, Zen of Python

# functions - type hints


# type hints and function documentation is important to ensure readability and
# reusability of code
def get_rock_properties(rocktype: str) -> tuple:
    '''A function that returns rock properties according to ISO 14689 for
    different lithologies'''

    match rocktype:  # noqa
        case 'granite':
            ucs, color = 150, 'pink'
        case 'marl':
            ucs, color = 20, 'dark grey'
        case _:  # match case - wildcard / else output
            ucs, color = 'unknown', 'unknown'

    return ucs, color

ucs_rock, color_rock = get_rock_properties('granite')

print(ucs_rock, color_rock)

get_rock_properties()
