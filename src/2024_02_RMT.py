# repetition

###### control structures are used to control which parts of the code should be
# skipped or repeated
### conditional statements: if, elif, else, match cases

a = 40
b = 20

print(a < b)
print(a == b)
print(a != b and a < b)
print(a != b or a < b)

# exemplary conditional statement
if a < 50:
    print('a is smaller 50')
elif a < 100:
    print('a is smaller than 100')
elif a < 200:
    print('a is smaller than 200')
else:
    print('a is equal or larger than 200')
